title: Intro To Golang
---

Hello, 世界! This is a very basic entry to the wonderful world of Golang aka Go. You would think that in 2007 a new language would need a more unique name than "Go" I mean, it's already the name of an [ancient boardgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), not to mention there was already a programming languaged named [Go!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go!_(programming_language)).  Google's powers that be decided to run with it anyway (which caused [conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go!_(programming_language)#Conflict_with_Google)).


Anyway, Go was created in 2007 by three guys ([Robert Griesemer](https://github.com/griesemer), [Rob Pike](https://github.com/robpike), and [Ken Thompson](https://github.com/ken)) at Google. If you're a programming language nerd, you may recongize the last name, Ken Thompson developed the programming language [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)), of which C was superseded by C (which then was expanded to C++ which Ken [wasn't a fan of](https://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/coders-c-plus-plus/)). 


Believe it or not, Go was created because because Google wanted to create a modern systems language to deal with the [current state of computers and commputational needs](https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project). Or maybe because the developer behind it just [hated C++](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson#.22Interview_with_Ken_Thompson.22.2C_2011). Whicch is kind of hilarious, as Google has been known to be a [C++ shop](https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-languages-does-Google-use-internally) ([ps- they have their own style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)). (I would avoid it if I hated C++ just like I avoid coldFusion shops.)


At any rate, Go was developed specficically to
