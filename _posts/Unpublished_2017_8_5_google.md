title: About the Google Memo
---

I've been neglecting this blog, and for that my apologizes. I feel compelled to write about a Google employee's memo that is making the rounds. [Gizmodo has full text here](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320/amp).

Disclaimer: I'm a woman. I'm a lesbian. I'm white. I was raised middle-class. I started an undergrad in CompSci in the year 2000. I changed majors after 3 years and graduated with a degree in Biology. I worked as a chemist in a lab for about 4.5 years, then I went back to school and did a Master's in Computer Science. I've been working in the industry sinnce 2011, I've worked in the SF Bay area, and in the midwest. I can only speak to my experience. 

I enjoy how the whole thing starts with the line:

> I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don’t endorse using stereotypes. 

1.) No, you don't. You question it's value numerous times by the end of the memo.

2.) I'm glad you're aware that sexism exists. I am guessing you don't know what it looks like or you're just cool with being sexist.

3.) You don't endorse using stereotypes, but you do use them (women tend to be people oriented, so we shouldn't expect to be able to have a diverse workforce?)

His second line is:

> When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. 

AKA let's use stereotypes to explain why we don't need more diversity! 

The essay doesn't get any better.

>Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don’t have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.

This is silly. Even assuming it's true, how many leadership in tech roles does Google have? Are such a strikingly high percentage of women so radically different than men that 50% of them cannot be filled with qualified women? It may be different in terms of feasibility if you're asking it about all companies, but this is only one company, one with particular pull for ambitious people, what with the name recognition, budget, and perks.
