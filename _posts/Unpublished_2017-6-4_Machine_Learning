Just to change gears a bit, I've decided to apply my new go skills to a machine learning problem. Now I took Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in graduate school, but that was five years ago and I haven't had occasion to use it for work since. 

A very minor product at my work is a call-in line for a manufacturer for the citizens who live by their plants.  They also have a line people can call to hear announcements.
