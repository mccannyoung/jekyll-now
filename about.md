I am a Senior Software Engineer (SE III) at a communications company. I like learning new languages, best practices, and how to kick butt.

### Why blog?

I'm blogging because 
- I have a lot of thoughts
- I need to write stuff down to remember it
- I like the idea of sharing information in an easy to consume format
- Most (but not all) of the tech bloggers I've come across are men, and I want our field to look like less of a boy's club

### Why The Red Queen's Race?

I believe [this concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_race) illustrates an important fact about having a career in software development or engineering. I think this is the dirty little secret they don't teach you in school, that if you want to be excellent (and in some locations just employable) you will have to continually learn. Most of the new skills I learn will be obsolete in 2-5 years. 

### Current Interests

Currently my jam is: golang, microservices, docker, C#, dotNet Core, API, ruby, message brokers, and non-relational databases. I'm passionate about helping women and girls explore their interests in technology, especially programing. Outside of the tech world, I like to run with my dog on trails and read bad mystery novels (bonus if it's set in Minneapolis in the 1990s).
